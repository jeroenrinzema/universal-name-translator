# Universal name translator

A Star Trek device. It was supposedly first used in the late 22nd century on Earth for the instant translation of well-known Earth languages. This project tries to extend its capabilities to support alien languages.

## Supported languages

- **more languages tba**

## Getting started

Currently, it is only possible to get the binaries from the source. Clone or download this project and install the binaries by running `go build .`

Once built you could start translating by executing the CLI and passing the input that you want to be translated as arguments.

```bash
$ ./universal-name-translator Uhura
$ ./universal-name-translator Spock Two
```
